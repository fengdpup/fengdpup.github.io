My name is Daipeng Feng. I am a second-year M.Eng. student majoring in computer science in Sun Yat-sen University advised by [Prof. Xu Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/xcsysu/). I received my B.E. from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University. My research interests include edge intelligence and ML-inspired distributed system.
